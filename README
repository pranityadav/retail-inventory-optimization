🔍 Overview

Retail businesses lose revenue due to poor inventory decisions—either stocking too little (lost sales) or stocking too much (holding and wastage costs).

This project is an end-to-end data science system that:
	•	Forecasts product demand using machine learning
	•	Converts predictions into actionable inventory recommendations
	•	Estimates financial impact of inventory decisions
	•	Provides a user-friendly web interface for non-technical users

The goal is decision support, not just prediction accuracy.

⸻

🎯 Problem Statement

Most small and mid-size retailers rely on:
	•	intuition
	•	recent sales trends
	•	simple heuristics

These methods ignore demand variability, seasonality, and uncertainty, leading to:
	•	frequent stockouts
	•	overstocking
	•	avoidable financial loss

⸻

💡 Solution

The system follows a business-driven ML pipeline:
	1.	Demand Forecasting (Regression)
	•	Predicts future sales quantity per product
	•	Implemented using XGBoost
	2.	Inventory Decision Logic
	•	Converts predicted demand into recommended stock levels
	•	Incorporates safety stock assumptions
	3.	Cost Simulation
	•	Estimates financial impact of overstocking and understocking
	•	Compares ML strategy vs a naive baseline
	4.	Web Application
	•	CSV upload → predictions → inventory recommendations → downloadable results

📊 Model Evaluation (Why “Accuracy” Is Not Used)

This is a regression problem, not classification.
	•	There are no “correct / incorrect” labels
	•	Therefore, accuracy is not a valid metric

Metrics Used
	•	MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
	•	RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
Interpretation:
The ML model reduces demand prediction error by nearly 50% compared to a naive baseline.

⸻

💰 Business Impact

Beyond prediction metrics, the system evaluates real business outcomes.

📉 Result:

~62% reduction in inventory-related costs compared to a baseline strategy.

This demonstrates that the model improves decision quality, not just numeric accuracy.

🖥️ Live Application

The deployed Streamlit app allows users to:
	•	Upload sales data (CSV)
	•	View forecasted demand
	•	Receive recommended inventory levels
	•	See estimated cost impact
	•	Download results for operational use

⚠️ Assumptions & Limitations
	•	Input data must follow the defined schema
	•	Future demand patterns resemble historical trends
	•	Cost savings depend on assumed understock/overstock penalties
	•	Intended as a decision-support tool, not guaranteed profit

⸻

🔮 Future Improvements
	•	Probabilistic forecasting with confidence intervals
	•	Product-specific cost parameters
	•	Lead-time-aware inventory planning
	•	Automated retraining with new data
	•	Integration with POS / ERP systems

⸻

🧠 What This Project Demonstrates
	•	Correct metric selection for regression problems
	•	Translating ML predictions into business decisions
	•	Measuring success via financial impact
	•	End-to-end ownership from data → model → deployment
