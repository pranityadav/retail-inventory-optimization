# Retail Demand Forecasting & Inventory Optimization System

## Problem Statement

Retail businesses frequently lose revenue due to poor inventory decisions — either by stocking too little (stockouts) or too much (overstocking). Traditional inventory planning often relies on intuition or naive heuristics, leading to avoidable losses.

## Solution Overview

This project builds an end-to-end data science system that forecasts product demand and converts those predictions into actionable inventory recommendations. Instead of stopping at prediction accuracy, the system simulates real-world inventory costs to quantify business impact.

## Key Features

- Multi-product demand forecasting using XGBoost
- Time-series feature engineering (lags, rolling statistics, calendar effects)
- Inventory optimization using safety stock logic
- Simulation of understock and overstock costs
- User-friendly web application for CSV-based input and output

## How the System Works

1. User uploads historical sales data (CSV)
2. The system validates and preprocesses the data
3. Demand is forecasted for each product independently
4. Forecasts are converted into inventory decisions
5. Inventory costs are simulated to estimate financial impact
6. Results are presented and downloadable as a CSV

## Business Impact

Compared to a naive inventory strategy (using previous-day stock levels), the ML-driven approach reduced simulated inventory-related costs by approximately **62%** under defined cost assumptions.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Streamlit
