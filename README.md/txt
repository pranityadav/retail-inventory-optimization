📦 Retail Inventory Optimization using Machine Learning

🔍 Overview

Retail businesses frequently lose money due to poor inventory decisions—either stocking too little (leading to stockouts and lost sales) or stocking too much (leading to excess holding costs and wastage).

This project is an end-to-end data science system that:
	•	Forecasts product demand using machine learning
	•	Converts forecasts into actionable inventory recommendations
	•	Estimates financial impact using inventory cost simulation
	•	Provides a user-friendly web interface for non-technical users

The system is designed as a decision-support tool, not just a predictive model.

🎯 Problem Statement

Most small and mid-size retailers rely on:
	•	intuition,
	•	recent sales trends,
	•	or naive heuristics (e.g., yesterday’s sales = tomorrow’s stock)

These approaches ignore demand patterns, seasonality, and uncertainty, resulting in:
	•	frequent stockouts
	•	overstocking
	•	avoidable revenue loss

⸻

💡 Solution

This project builds a pipeline that goes beyond prediction accuracy and focuses on business decisions:
	1.	Demand Forecasting
Uses historical sales data to predict near-term product demand using XGBoost.
	2.	Inventory Optimization
Converts predicted demand into recommended stock levels using safety-stock logic.
	3.	Cost Simulation
Quantifies the financial impact of:
	•	understocking (lost sales)
	•	overstocking (holding costs)
	4.	Web Application
A Streamlit-based UI allows store owners to upload sales data and receive:
	•	recommended inventory levels
	•	forecasted demand
	•	estimated cost impact
	•	downloadable results

⸻

🚀 Key Features
	•	Multi-product demand forecasting
	•	Time-series feature engineering (lags, rolling statistics, calendar features)
	•	Machine learning model using XGBoost
	•	Baseline vs ML model comparison
	•	Inventory decision logic with cost assumptions
	•	Interactive web interface (CSV upload → results)
	•	Fully deployed public web app

📊 Business Impact

Under simulated inventory cost assumptions, the ML-driven strategy achieved:

~62% reduction in inventory-related costs
compared to a naive baseline strategy.

This demonstrates how predictive models can translate into measurable operational impact, not just better metrics.

📂 Input Data Format

The application expects a CSV file with the following columns:
date,store_id,item_id,sales

Column Description
	•	date – Date of sale (YYYY-MM-DD)
	•	store_id – Store identifier
	•	item_id – Product identifier
	•	sales – Units sold

A sample CSV is provided directly in the web app for reference.

⸻

📤 Output

For each product, the system produces:
	•	Forecasted demand
	•	Recommended inventory level
	•	Estimated inventory-related cost
	•	Downloadable CSV for operational use

⚠️ Assumptions & Limitations
	•	Input data must follow the specified CSV schema
	•	Forecasts assume future demand patterns resemble historical trends
	•	Cost estimates depend on assumed understock and overstock penalties
	•	The system is intended for decision support, not guaranteed profit

⸻

🔮 Future Improvements
	•	Per-product cost configuration
	•	Lead-time-aware inventory planning
	•	Probabilistic forecasting with confidence intervals
	•	Automated model retraining with new data
	•	Integration with POS / ERP systems

⸻

🧠 What This Project Demonstrates
	•	Translating ML outputs into business decisions
	•	End-to-end ownership (data → model → deployment)
	•	Practical trade-offs in real-world systems
	•	Clear separation between modeling and decision logic
